# Does javascript and classes

Yes, JavaScript does have classes, although they were not part of the language originally. Classes in JavaScript were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) in 2015. They provide a more familiar syntax for creating objects and managing inheritance, resembling classes in other object-oriented programming languages like Java or C#. However, it's important to understand that JavaScript classes are primarily syntactical sugar over its existing prototype-based inheritance model.
