// JavaScript is a dynamically typed language , which means that 
// data types of variables are determined by the value they hold at runtime
// and can change throughout the program as we assign different values to them.


//  Primitive

//  7 types : String, Number, Boolearn, null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt

const score = 100
const scoreValue = 100.3

const isLoggedIn = false
const outsideTemp = null
let userEmail;

const id = Symbol('123')
const anotherId = Symbol('123')

console.log(id === anotherId);

// Reference (Non primitive)

// Array, Objects, Functions
